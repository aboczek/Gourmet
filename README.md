# Gourmet Restaurant Portfolio Project 1


# Motivation:


### This project is about restaurant, menu and booking table. 
### Main purpose of this project is to present landing page of the restaurant with menu, drinks, booking table and contact us/about us.

### I chose this project over any other one is because how hard it is to get pictures without copyright on them. 
### Wanted something nice and sleek.
